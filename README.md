# calendarific_api
I used https://calendarific.com/ to fetch information about holidays in every country
I used https://www.worldometers.info/geography/flags-of-the-world/ in order to add correct flags for every country
Every time when you search a new country, information push into local storage and then this information from local storage push 
to table.
Countries names in table are clickable and show again information about holidays for that country
On the other side of any card you can see a little description about holiday
